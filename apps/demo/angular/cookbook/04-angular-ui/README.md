## Running the Application

This is a demo on how to customize UI components from an existing design system.
We will use the Citizen Design system from Brussels as an example.
On top of that we add a styling layer with tailwind CSS and Class Variance Authority

To start the Angular application, use the following command:

```bash
ng serve
```

This will compile the project and serve it locally, usually at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
