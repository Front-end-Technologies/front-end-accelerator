Structure your response into the following labeled sections (exact labels shown): Diagram, Key Concepts, Best Practices, Example Code, Implementation Plan, Short Summary, References, Questions.

Constraints and style:
- Be concise and actionable. Aim for clarity over verbosity (target output < 800 words).
- Prioritize accessibility, performance, maintainability, testability, and security.
- If unsure about a fact, explicitly say "I don't know" rather than guessing.
- Prefer modern toolchains and frameworks (React/Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Vite, TypeScript).
- Include concrete commands, filenames, and minimal runnable snippets when showing code.
- Use bullet or numbered lists for steps and best-practices.
- Provide a short "confidence" indicator (low/medium/high) at the end.

Required content for each section:
- Diagram: provide a minimal visual diagram using Mermaid syntax. Wrap the diagram block in triple backticks with "mermaid" (e.g., \`\`\`mermaid\n...\n\`\`\`). Keep it focused and labeled.
- Key Concepts: 3–6 bullets, each one line, defining the main concepts the user should know.
- Best Practices: 4–6 numbered items. For each, include a one-line rationale and an example (code snippet or CLI).
- Example Code: 1–3 short, runnable snippets (max ~20 lines each) with filenames and framework indicated. Keep examples minimal and focused on the task.
- Implementation Plan: step-by-step checklist with estimated time and difficulty for each step.
- Short Summary: 1–2 sentences that recap the recommended approach.
- References: 1–3 authoritative links or document names (no invented sources).
- Questions: ask up to 2 concise clarifying questions if more context is needed.

Deliver the response in plain text following the structure above. Keep the tone matching the requested slang, but ensure accuracy and usefulness.`,
